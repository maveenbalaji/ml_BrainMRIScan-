# Brain Tumor Detection Using Fuzzy Algorithm

This project is designed to detect brain tumors in medical images using a fuzzy logic algorithm. The algorithm processes MRI scan images of the brain, applies image processing techniques, and uses fuzzy logic to classify tumor regions. This repository contains the code for training, evaluating, and running the brain tumor detection model.

## Introduction
Brain tumor detection is critical for early diagnosis and treatment planning. The fuzzy logic algorithm used in this project helps identify regions of interest (ROIs) in MRI brain images. It provides an efficient way to detect abnormal growth in the brain, enabling healthcare professionals to make timely decisions.

The model applies fuzzy rules to classify pixel intensity and detect abnormal tissue patterns associated with brain tumors. The output of the model is a classification of the tumor type, if present.

## Features
- Preprocessing of MRI images (noise removal, normalization).
- Image segmentation using fuzzy logic to detect tumor regions.
- Visualization of detected tumor regions on MRI images.
- Classification of tumor type based on features extracted from the image.
- User-friendly interface for loading and processing MRI images.
